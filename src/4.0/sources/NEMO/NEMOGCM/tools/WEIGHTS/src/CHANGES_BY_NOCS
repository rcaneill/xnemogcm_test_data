      SCRIP code, version 1.4, from Los Alamos National Laboratory (http://climate.lanl.gov/Software/SCRIP)

      Changes made at NOCS for inclusion of weights generation code in NEMO 3.3 and later:

          - File extensions changed from '.f' to '.f90'
          - File netcdf.f renamed as netcdf_mod.f90 to avoid clash with netcdf library module filename
          - File netcdf.f modified to add error message to netcdf_error_handler
          - Small bug in remap_conserv when using gfortran compiler: replace ". and." with " .and."
          - continuation lines reformatted with '&' moved from the start of the continuation line to 
            the end of the line before
