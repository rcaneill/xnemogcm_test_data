================================
= HOW TO COMPILE
================================
The DOMAINcfg tool can be compiled using the maketools script in the NEMOGCM/TOOLS directory as follows:
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
./maketools -m $ARCH -n DOMAINcfg
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
where $ARCH indicates the arch file to be used from the directory NEMOGCM/ARCH. 

DOMAINcfg compiled will create "make_domain_cfg.exe" executable script (the main routine of this tool is make_domain_cfg.f90)

================================
= HOW TO RUN
================================
just run :
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
mpirun -np 1 ./make_domain_cfg.exe
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
NOTA: it can be run in multiproc mode, but in output there will be domain_cfg_00xx.nc files

 === Closed seas (closea module) ===

If you want to define closed seas in the bathymetry either to suppress them at runtime or 
redistribute freshwater fluxes, then you need to run make_closea_masks.py after you have
created the basic domain_cfg file. This utility will add "closea_mask*" fields to the
domain_cfg file to define the closed seas in the configuration. (If you have closed seas
but don't want to treat them in a special way then you can ignore this step). 

================================
= HOW TO USE
================================
1) copy in DOMAINcfg  directory namelist_cfg all settings (that you had in 3.6_stable) of the configuration for which you want prepare domain_cfg.nc file
IMPORTANT : keep the namelist_ref committed inchanged. !!!

NEW OPTION ln_e3_dep in the namelist_ref:
till nemo_v3.6_stable e3 were done like an analytical derivative of depth function
now  e3=dk[depth] in discret sens

If you want to create same e3[tuvw] like 3.6 you've to use "ln_e3_dep=.false."

 ln_e3_dep   = .true.    ! =T : e3=dk[depth] in discret sens.
   !                       !      ===>>> will become the only possibility in v4.0
   !                       ! =F : e3 analytical derivative of depth function
   !                       !      only there for backward compatibility test with v3.6
   !

2) copy in DOMAINcfg directory same input files (of related configuration) required in v3.6_stable.

DOMAINcfg package is EXACTLY what does exist in NEMO version 3.6 to define a model domain (both domain related namelist and initialization).
DOMAINcfg tool creates a netcdf file "domain_cfg.nc" containing all the ocean domain informations required to define an ocean configuration,
these files are :
          
    domain size
    domain characteristics (periodic)
    horizontal mesh
    Coriolis parameter
    depth and vertical scale factors

FOR EXAMPLE 
- for AMM12 : 
            coordinates.nc
            bathy_meter.nc
            bathy_level.nc
            amm12_rivers.nc
            coordinates.bdy.nc
            amm12_restart_oce.nc
         directories:   bdydta/
                        fluxes/
- for ORCA2 : 
            coordinates.nc
            bathy_meter.nc
            bathy_level.nc
            domain_def.xml
            field_def.xml
            iodef.xml
