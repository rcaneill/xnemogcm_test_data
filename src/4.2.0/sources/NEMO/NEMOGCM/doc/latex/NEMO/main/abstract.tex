%% Specific part
The primitive equation model is adapted to regional and global ocean circulation problems down to
kilometric scale.
Prognostic variables are the three-dimensional velocity field, a non-linear sea surface height,
the \textit{Conservative} Temperature and the \textit{Absolute} Salinity.
In the horizontal direction, the model uses a curvilinear orthogonal grid and
in the vertical direction, a full or partial step $z$-coordinate, or $s$-coordinate, or
a mixture of the two.
The distribution of variables is a three-dimensional Arakawa C-type grid.
Various physical choices are available to describe ocean physics,
so as various HPC functionalities to improve performances.
