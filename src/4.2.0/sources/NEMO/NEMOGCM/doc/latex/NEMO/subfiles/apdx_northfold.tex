When \forcode{l_Iperio = .true.}, \forcode{l_NFold = .true.} and \forcode{c_NFtype = 'T'} the North Pole Folding is done around 2 T-points. This is the case in ORCA 2\deg, 1/4\deg, 1/12\deg and 1/36\deg.

    Cells in the halos, outside of the inner domain (thick black line), will be defined by using only the values in the inner domain when calling the \rou{lbc\_lnk} routine (found in \mdl{lbclnk} module).

    Cells with the same color are at the same geographical location. Color shading shows the change in gradient on each side of the pivot-points.}
