Release 1.1
===========
Modified for compilation by fcm in NEMO 3.3 framework.
SCRIP 1.4 package included in unmodified form.
python script added to transform into correct shape for fcm, producing copied code in 'src' directory

scripshape.F90 now has one possible command line argument: the namelist file
               from which it reads the names of the input and output files 
               as well as the value for the cyclicity attribute

Because gfortran doesnt understand ICHAR and GETCHAR system routines default behaviour of all programs
is to ask for namelist filename during execution rather than reading it from the command line.
Define symbol ARGC at compilation to return to original command line behaviour.

Release 1.0
===========
Routines written by sga and acc at NOCS to use SCRIP library to produce weights

Compilation by makefile and explicit compiler and options.
