# How to get support
  If you have questions regarding the use of SIREN, please have a look at the [NEMO configuration manager forum](https://forge.ipsl.jussieu.fr/nemo/discussion/forum/2).<br/>
  If you don't find an answer in the archives, feel free to register and post your question.

# How to Help
   The development of SIREN highly depends on your input!<br/>
   If you are trying SIREN let me know what you think of it (do you miss certain features?). Even if you decide not to use it, please let me know why.

# How to report a bug
   If you believe you have found a new bug, please report it.<br/>
   Before submitting a new bug, first search through the database if the same bug has already been submitted by others

   If you send only a (vague) description of a bug, you are usually not very
   helpful and it will cost much more time to figure out what you mean. In
   the worst-case your bug report may even be completely ignored.
